- Keeps Bluetooth audio connection alive by playing a very low-volume tone.
- Runs as a **Windows Service**.
- **Auto-starts** with Windows boot.

## ‚ùì Notes

- The tone frequency is 15000 Hz at 0.001 volume ‚Äî inaudible to humans but sufficient to maintain Bluetooth activity. (15000 Hz volume ‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà‡∏ï‡πà‡∏≥‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏≠‡∏î‡∏†‡∏±‡∏¢‡∏ï‡πà‡∏≠‡∏Ñ‡∏ô‡πÅ‡∏•‡∏∞‡∏™‡∏±‡∏ï‡∏ß‡πå‡πÅ‡∏•‡∏∞‡∏≠‡∏∏‡∏õ‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏ì‡πå)
- Ensure the PC audio output is set to the **Bluetooth speaker**.
- This tool does **not** produce any sound that you can hear.
- Ideal for users with speakers like Marshall Acton III which auto-disconnect on silence.
